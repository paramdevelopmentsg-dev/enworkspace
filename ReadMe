to evaluate their capabilities, performance, and suitability for various application scenarios

OpenAI SDK

What is OpenAI SDK?

The OpenAI SDK for building AI agents is a lightweight, production-ready framework designed to create intelligent AI models—called agents—that can follow instructions, use external tools, and delegate tasks to other agents. Its key features and working principles include:
Agents as core entities: Each agent represents a language model configured with specific instructions and equipped with tools to perform specialized roles such as code generation, information retrieval, or task automation.
Tool integration: Agents can execute code, query databases, perform web searches, or call APIs using “function tools,” which are Python functions decorated to be exposed as callable tools for agents.
Multi-agent coordination: The SDK supports dynamic “handoffs” where tasks can be delegated automatically between specialized agents, enabling efficient collaboration to handle complex workflows.
Built-in lifecycle management: It includes an agent loop that manages iterative actions like tool invocation and response evaluation, automating repetitive orchestration and decision cycles.
Safety guardrails: Real-time validation and safety checks help ensure reliable, consistent outputs and prevent hallucinations or undesired behaviors.
Tracing and debugging: Visualization and monitoring tools provide insights into agent interactions and workflows, making development and troubleshooting easier.
Python-first approach: The SDK is designed to integrate with Python seamlessly, making it accessible to developers familiar with the language and enabling easy creation of custom tools and dynamic instructions.

This SDK allows developers to rapidly prototype and deploy sophisticated, reliable AI agents capable of autonomous decision-making, task execution, and multi-agent collaboration for applications like customer service bots, autonomous research assistants, and automation frameworks.

You can build an AI agent using the OpenAI SDK as the orchestrator while connecting to other LLMs via their API URLs. This allows your agent to leverage multiple models simultaneously, combining reasoning, summarization, search, or code-generation strengths.

Components

| Component  | Role             | Key Purpose                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent**  | AI “brain”       | Plans, reasons, calls tools                    |
| **Trace**  | Execution log    | Records steps, tool calls, reasoning           |
| **Runner** | Execution engine | Runs the agent, manages memory, produces trace |


Agent = “What to do”
Runner = “How to do it”
Trace = “What was done”

Features

Agent loop: Built-in agent loop that handles calling tools, sending results to the LLM, and looping until the LLM is done.
Python-first: Use built-in language features to orchestrate and chain agents, rather than needing to learn new abstractions.
Handoffs: A powerful feature to coordinate and delegate between multiple agents.
Guardrails: Run input validations and checks in parallel to your agents, breaking early if the checks fail.
Sessions: Automatic conversation history management across agent runs, eliminating manual state handling.
Function tools: Turn any Python function into a tool, with automatic schema generation and Pydantic-powered validation.
Tracing: Built-in tracing that lets you visualize, debug and monitor your workflows, as well as use the OpenAI suite of evaluation, fine-tuning and distillation tools.

Installation

pip install openai-agents
